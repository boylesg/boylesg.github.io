			<h2>Maryborough - untapped potential</h2>
			
			<p class="blurb">From the first time I arrived at Maryborough station, on a VLine train, I was blown away by 
			the sheer beauty of your station. The station represents a HUGELY underutilised tourism and historical asset. 
			But it needs something in addition that is truly special to entice tourists to come to Maryborough. And is 
			hard to imagine something more SPECIAL than a momentary step back in time with a steam train ride from 
			Southern Cross to historic Maryborough station. Not a restored steam train but rather a newly built one, 
			with the apperance  and feel of a 19th or early 20th century steam train and period carriages, but with 
			the usual 21st century comfort and amenities.</p>

			<p>To date any plans for tourism in the goldfields seem be isolated projects that don't form a greater whole. 
			One example is your rail trail. It is a good idea in and of itself. But hard to see how it is going to realise 
			the predicted influx of tourists for Maryborough. To begin not many tourists travel with their own bcicycles, 
			by car or by train. And there are many other rail trails with more enticing offerings for tourists Maryborough 
			or Castlemaine have at the present time.</p>
								
			<p>Here are some examples of rail trails with enticing scenic and gastronomic offerings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Beechworth: Take your feet off the pedals at Beechworth along the Murray to Mountains Rail 
				Trail. A cut above your average pit stop, this picturesque gold-rush town is renowned for food and 
				wine. Quench your thirst at historic Billson's Brewery and try small-batch wines at Eldorado Road 
				Cellar Door Cantina. Revitalise at the Beechworth Spa, and book ahead for chef's-hatted dining at 
				Provenance. Take a tour of local wineries before returning to the trail.</li>

				<li>Bright: Beautiful Bright is a top stop for two-wheelers along the Murray to Mountains Rail Trail. The 
				town is surrounded by mountain-bike trails and family-friendly sections of the rail trail. Out of 
				the saddle, gastronomy rules at boutique wineries and fine eateries making the most of local 
				produce. Pull in to Bright Brewery, Reed &amp; Co Distillery, Sixpence Coffee and Billy Button 
				Cellar Door.</li>
				
				<li>Rutherglen: There's no overlooking wee Rutherglen – Victoria's fortified wine capital – along 
				the Murray to Mountains. Cycle between historic cellar doors, stopping in at Jones Winery, Scion, 
				Campbells, and Stanton &amp; Killeen. Dine in at the restaurant at Jones's or spread out with a picnic, 
				and stay in the onsite tiny house overnight. Look for Rutherglen's giant wine bottle on Campbell 
				St.</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p>In addition to this, and to get the best patronage of your rail trail as possible, how about a push bike and 
			eBike hire and drop service at the Maryborough and Castlemaine ends. That way you are not limiting this great new 
			asset to the small number of tourists travelling with their bicycles. Also think about being inclusive of 
			disabled folks with tricycles etc.</p>
