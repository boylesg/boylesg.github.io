			<h2>Maryborough - untapped potential</h2>
			
				<p class="blurb">From the first time I arrived at Maryborough station, on a VLine train, I was blown away by 
				the sheer beauty of your station. Although Ballarat station and Castlemaine stations are historic edifices 
				in their own rights, they just don't leave the same impression as Maryborough station does. The station 
				represents a HUGELY underutilised tourism and historical asset. It needs to be the centerpriece of an ambitious 
				and comprehesive tourism plan for the Maryborough and all the goldfields towns. To date any plans for tourism in 
				the goldfields seem be isolated projects that don't form a greater whole. One example is your rail trail. It is 
				a good idea in and of itself. But hard to see how it is going to realise the predicted influx of tourists for 
				Maryborough. Not many tourists travel with their own bcicycles,  by car or by train.</p>
				
				<p>There are many rail trails across Victoria that have more enticing offerings for tourists than Maryborough or 
				Castlemaine have at the present time:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Beechworth: Take your feet off the pedals at Beechworth along the Murray to Mountains Rail 
					Trail. A cut above your average pit stop, this picturesque gold-rush town is renowned for food and 
					wine. Quench your thirst at historic Billson's Brewery and try small-batch wines at Eldorado Road 
					Cellar Door Cantina. Revitalise at the Beechworth Spa, and book ahead for chef's-hatted dining at 
					Provenance. Take a tour of local wineries before returning to the trail.</li>

					<li>Bright: Beautiful Bright is a top stop for two-wheelers along the Murray to Mountains Rail Trail. The 
					town is surrounded by mountain-bike trails and family-friendly sections of the rail trail. Out of 
					the saddle, gastronomy rules at boutique wineries and fine eateries making the most of local 
					produce. Pull in to Bright Brewery, Reed &amp; Co Distillery, Sixpence Coffee and Billy Button 
					Cellar Door.</li>
					
					<li>Rutherglen: There's no overlooking wee Rutherglen – Victoria's fortified wine capital – along 
					the Murray to Mountains. Cycle between historic cellar doors, stopping in at Jones Winery, Scion, 
					Campbells, and Stanton &amp; Killeen. Dine in at the restaurant at Jones's or spread out with a picnic, 
					and stay in the onsite tiny house overnight. Look for Rutherglen's giant wine bottle on Campbell 
					St.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Maryborough, and the goldfields broadly, will need to bring something else unique to the table in order 
				to get tourists to come to your rail trail, rather than the many other better offerings across Victoria. 
				And the one thing that Maryborough has is that stunning historic station. What can Maryborough offer to 
				tourists that is TRULY special to realise the full potential of its station? Something that might even 
				entice them to leave their cars at home and jump on a train?</p>
				
				<p>And is hard to imagine soemthing more SPECIAL than a momentary step back in time with a steam train ride 
				from Southern Cross to historic Maryborough station. Not a restored steam train but rather a newly built 
				one, with the apperance  and feel of a 19th or early 20th century steam train and period carriages, but 
				with the usual 21st century comfort and amenities.</p>
				
				<p>In addition to this, and to get the best patronage of your rail trail as possible, how about a push bike and 
				eBike hire and drop service at the Maryborough and Castlemaine ends. That way you are not limiting this great new 
				asset to the small number of tourists travelling with their bicycles. Also think about being inclusive of 
				disabled folks with tricycles etc.</p>

			<p>
				Maryborough, and nearby towns, offer you this unique opportunity to participate in our history with a wide range
				of immersive historical experiences. Such as push bike and horse guided tours of the old digging and ruins. We also 
				assorted 19th century re-enactments, such as at Dunolly police station and court house. As well as a variety of small 
				museums and displays featuring relics from the goldrush, and from various stages of the region's 
				development over the subsequent decades, including WW1.

			<p>
				Also don't miss out on the opportunity to learn about culture of our indigenous Australians from the region. 
				See their art, both modern and from their history. Examine their historical artefacts and technology. Have a 
				go at some of their skills, like starting a fire without matches or flints. Experience a smoking ceremony. They 
				have a proud 60,000 year plus history in the region and across Australia.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also have some modern experiences like splash park for your kids at the public pool, an indigenous Australian art 
				gallery, a tour of the nearby wind farm and a rail trail from Maryborough to Castmemaine. Enjoy a bike ride or 
				hike between our towns. We also have a McDonalds and Subway restaurants, along with fish and chips, pizza, Chinese and 
				Thai.
			</p>
			
			<p>In Maryborough (and surrounding towns) you will experience good old fashioned Australian country hospitality. You will 
			bw welcomed into the community and shown around by guides and locals alike.</p>
