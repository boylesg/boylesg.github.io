			<h2>Maryborough - untapped potential</h2>
			
				<p>From the first time I arrived at Maryborough station, on a VLine train, I was blown away by the sheer 
				beauty of your station. Although Ballarat station and Castlemaine stations are historic edifices in their 
				own rights, they just don't leave the same impression as Maryborough station does. 
				</p>
				
				<p>On closer examination it needs a gratb deal of work to prevent parts of it being lost over time. Much  
				of the brick work has suffered salt damage and is crumbling away, there are broken glass panes that are 
				potentially letting in the weather, the internal stair case behind the visitor's center is falling apart and
				the entire up stairs portion (including the cartakes cottage) is run down and totally unutilised.</p>
				
				<p>Despite these problems the station represents a HUGELY underutilised tourism and historical asset. It needs 
				to be the centerpriece of an ambitious and comprehesive tourism plan for the Maryborough and the surrounding 
				goldfields towns.</p>
				
				<p>So far plans for tourism in the goldfields seem to amount to isolated projects that don't connect together 
				as a greater whole. One example is your rail trail. It is a good idea in and of itself. But unless it is 
				connected with a wider plan then it hard to see how it it is going to realise the predicted tourism dollars 
				for Maryborough. Not many tourists are going to come to Maryborough just for this rail trail as 
				there are many more scenic and gastronomic offerings such as:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Beechworth: Take your feet off the pedals at Beechworth along the Murray to Mountains Rail 
					Trail. A cut above your average pit stop, this picturesque gold-rush town is renowned for food and 
					wine. Quench your thirst at historic Billson's Brewery and try small-batch wines at Eldorado Road 
					Cellar Door Cantina. Revitalise at the Beechworth Spa, and book ahead for chef's-hatted dining at 
					Provenance. Take a tour of local wineries before returning to the trail.</li>

					<li>Bright: Beautiful Bright is a top stop for two-wheelers along the Murray to Mountains Rail Trail. The 
					town is surrounded by mountain-bike trails and family-friendly sections of the rail trail. Out of 
					the saddle, gastronomy rules at boutique wineries and fine eateries making the most of local 
					produce. Pull in to Bright Brewery, Reed &amp; Co Distillery, Sixpence Coffee and Billy Button 
					Cellar Door.</li>
					
					<li>Rutherglen: There's no overlooking wee Rutherglen – Victoria's fortified wine capital – along 
					the Murray to Mountains. Cycle between historic cellar doors, stopping in at Jones Winery, Scion, 
					Campbells, and Stanton &amp; Killeen. Dine in at the restaurant at Jones's or spread out with a picnic, 
					and stay in the onsite tiny house overnight. Look for Rutherglen's giant wine bottle on Campbell 
					St.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Maryborough, and the goldfields broadly, will need to bring something else unique to the table in order 
				to get tourists to come to you, and your rail trail, rather than the above offerings. And the one thing that 
				Maryborough has is historic architecture, particularly your station. But you will also need to make the trip 
				to Maryborough SPECIAL for tourists.</p>
				
				<p>And what better way than to have them travel from Southern Cross to historic Maryborough station on a historic 
				steam train. No necessarily a restored steam train, newly built one, with the look and feel of a 19th or 
				ealry 20th century steam, but with the usual 21st century comfort and amenities. </p>

			<p>
				Maryborough, and nearby towns, offer you this unique opportunity to participate in our history with a wide range
				of immersive historical experiences. Such as push bike and horse guided tours of the old digging and ruins. We also 
				assorted 19th century re-enactments, such as at Dunolly police station and court house. As well as a variety of small 
				museums and displays featuring relics from the goldrush, and from various stages of the region's 
				development over the subsequent decades, including WW1.

			<p>
				Also don't miss out on the opportunity to learn about culture of our indigenous Australians from the region. 
				See their art, both modern and from their history. Examine their historical artefacts and technology. Have a 
				go at some of their skills, like starting a fire without matches or flints. Experience a smoking ceremony. They 
				have a proud 60,000 year plus history in the region and across Australia.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also have some modern experiences like splash park for your kids at the public pool, an indigenous Australian art 
				gallery, a tour of the nearby wind farm and a rail trail from Maryborough to Castmemaine. Enjoy a bike ride or 
				hike between our towns. We also have a McDonalds and Subway restaurants, along with fish and chips, pizza, Chinese and 
				Thai.
			</p>
			
			<p>In Maryborough (and surrounding towns) you will experience good old fashioned Australian country hospitality. You will 
			bw welcomed into the community and shown around by guides and locals alike.</p>
