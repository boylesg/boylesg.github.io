			<p>The goldfields has a wide range of sites and experiences for tourists, all in conveninet and inexpensive 
			reach of Melbourne. Only a smattering of them have been realised to any signficant extent. They inlcude 
			Sovereign Hill, Eureka Stockade and the wildlife Park in Ballarat, the art gallery in Bendigo, 'The Mill' in 
			Castelmaine.</p>
			
			<p>In cooperation with each other the smaller towns along the train line, like Maryborough, could leverage that and ADD to those 
			experiences for tourists. The steam train loop and re-instated Maryborough to Castlemaine line would be 
			integral to that.</p>
			
			<p>But to get the tourists and keep them coming back you need more than just provide attractions and leave the 
			the tourist to it. How about 'garnishing' your offerings with some good old fashioned Australian country hopsitality. 
			Have the visitor center staff, and/or other designated individuals, to greet the tourists on the station platform 
			when the steam train arrives. Direct them where to go to meet up with their various tour guides or to the visitor center to 
			sign up for a tour. Provide a friendly face or faces to answer their questions and re-assure them.</p>

			<h2>Wagon &amp; Coach Rides</h2>
			<p>One really obvious experience for tourists, that cities like Ballarat and Bendigo would struggle with but that the 
			likes of Maryborough could EASILY provide, are wagon, stage coach and buggy rides. Both around the town center and 
			even between it and the closer satellite towns.</p>
			<img src="images/WagonRide.jpg" alt="images/WagonRide.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>
			<p>How about tours by horse around the lake, goldfields ruins and diggings?</p>
			<img src="images/TrailRides.jpg" alt="images/TrailRides.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h2>Gold detecting</h2>
			<p>A small number of tourists, particuarly any Australians, would likely love to have a go at gold detecting.</p>
			<img src="images/GoldDetetcting.jpg" alt="images/GoldDetetcting.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h2>Gem stone fossicking</h2>
			<p>Australians like me are more interested in fossicking for quartz crystal and chalcedony varieites. And they are 
			a great deal easier to find than gold nuggets.</p>
			<img src="images/GemFossicking.jpg" alt="images/GemFossicking.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h2>Wildflowers</h2>
			<p>Many Australian tourists, including this one, LOVE Australian flora. And you have one prolific native wild flower across 
			the area that I have noticed in passing. Bracteantha viscosa or Sticky Everlasting Daisy. No doubt there are MANY other 
			species in spring, particularly when rainfall is good.</p>
			<img src="images/WildFlowers.jpg" alt="images/WildFlowers.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h2>Indigenous Australian Art Gallery</h2>
			<p>Bendigo as a European Art Gallery. So why could Maryborough feature an Indigenous Australian art gallery.</p>
			<img src="images/Art.jpg" alt="images/Art.jpg" width="600"/>&nbsp;<img src="images/Culture.jpg" alt="images/Culture.jpg" width="630"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
			
			<h2>Indigenous Australian Cultural Activities</h2>
			<p>How mabout a range of Indigenous Australian cultural experience. It could inlcude smoking ceremonies, teaching tourists 
			to start a fire without matches or flints, recognize bush tucker plants and how to prepare and eat them and how to locate 
			water. One indigenous Australian I know of, Richard, seems to be an encyclpedia of knowledge. It seems a waste if there is 
			no avenue for individuals such as him to share some their expertise with visitors.</p>
			<img src="images/Culture.jpg" alt="images/Culture.jpg" width="630"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
			
			<h2>Cycling</h2>
			<p>How about tours by cycle around the lake, goldfields ruins and diggings? With a steam train loop the rail trail, 
			currently under construction, would become yet another cycling experience for tourists. Rather than a bit a of a whie 
			elephant.</p>
			<img src="images/Cycling.jpg" alt="images/Cycling.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h2>Re-enactments At Historic sites</h2>
			<p>You have a 19th century police station / court house and lockup in Dunolly. So a coach, buggy, wagon or tour bus ride to 
			the court house to see a re-enactment of a court case conducted by members of any local drama societies and theatre companies.</p>

			<img src="images/Reenactments.jpg" alt="images/Reenactments.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h2>Sewing machine museum &amp; other niche museums</h2>
			<p>At one point Maryborough apparently had a sewing machine museum, so bring that back! Along with some other small niche 
			museums. Crystals, gemstones and gold nugget relicas, particularly gold nuggets that have recently been found. Movie and 
			theatre memorabilia. Antique bottles and other atrifacts from the diggings.</p>
			<img src="images/SewingMachine.png" alt="images/SewingMachine.png" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h2>Historic Paramount theatre</h2>
			You have a great 1926 vintage Paramount Theatrel. Apart form Hollywood movies you could create 30 minute documentaries detailing 
			various aspects of Maryborough's history. Show them to interested visitors in comfort, and then follow up the viewings 
			with tours of the sites featured.

			<h2>Public pool</h2>
			<p>Put a splash park in it! But not a McSplash Park. How about one with a goldfields twist. It could include structures 
			that resemble sluices and boilers etc. Something along these lines but that scream 'goldfield diggings'.</p>
