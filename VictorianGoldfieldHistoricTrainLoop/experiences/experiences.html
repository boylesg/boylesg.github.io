			<p>The goldfields has a wide range of sites and experiences for tourists, all in conveninet and inexpensive 
			reach of Melbourne. Only a smattering of them have been realised to any signficant extent. They inlcude 
			Sovereign Hill, Eureka Stockade and the wildlife Park in Ballarat, the art gallery in Bendigo, 'The Mill' in 
			Castelmaine.</p>
			
			<p>In cooperation with each other the smaller towns along the train line, like Maryborough, could leverage that and ADD to those 
			experiences for tourists. The steam train loop and re-instated Maryborough to Castlemaine line would be 
			integral to that.</p>
			
			<p>But to get the tourists and keep them coming back you need more than just provide attractions and leave the 
			the tourist to it. How about 'garnishing' your offerings with some good old fashioned Australian country hopsitality! 
			Have the visitor center staff, and/or other designated individuals, to greet the tourists on the station platform 
			when the steam train arrives. Direct them where to go to meet up with their various tour guides or to the visitor center to 
			sign up for a tour. Provide a friendly face or faces to answer their questions and re-assure them.</p>

			
			<h2>Visitor's Center</h2>
			
			<p>Any visitors to your town must be wowed as soon as they step off the train. And your visitor center has to be the 
			ketstone of that.</p>
			
			<h3>Presentation</h3>
			
			<p>The mini theatre is a great idea, however that alone does not raise the current vistor's center much above 
			the status of underwhelming. As a visitor to Maryborough myself, your visitor centere, in its current form is barely even 
			noticeable from the platform when exiting the train. Even if I stepped through the door out of curiosity I am immediately hit 
			with this sort of feel:<br/>
			<img src="images/Reception.jpg" alt="images/Reception.jpg" /></p>
			
			<p>After watching your short film in the mini theatre, I am left with the feeling of wanting more. And other than that there 
			really isn't much more to hold my interest. You need to wow your visitors and leave them with the feeling of 
			wanting to get out there and explore the town and surrounds.</p>
			
			<p>All that is really needed are some display cases and shelves that together will turn your visistor's center into a
			a mini-museum. featuring things like these:</p>
			
			<u>
				<li>Mineral and gem stone samples.</li>
				<li>Replicas of gold nuggets recently found in the goldfields.</li>
				<li>A sample of antique sewing machines.</li>
				<li>Samples of indigenous Australian artwork</li>
				<li>Some pre-European indigenous Australian artefects</li>
				<li>Some samples of wildflowers from the goldfields, in pots.</li>
				<li>Plentiful borchures for all the experience that await them.</li>
			</u>
			
			<p>This visitor's center is done really well. It would certainly draw me in for 15 minutes at least to drink in 
			all the information and objects on display. Maryborough's visitor center should be presented in a similar way. There 
			is no need for any structure alterations. All it needs is some appropriate display cases, shelves and racks etc.<br/>
			<img src="images/VisitorCenter.jpg" alt="images/VisitorCenter.jpg" width="600" /></p>
			
			<h3>Greeting Visitors</h3>
			
			<p>The vistor center staff should greet the tourists on the platform when the steam service arrives, direct them to 
			where they need to go to meet up with tour guides and stage coach rides and make themselves availabe to proactively 
			answer their questions etc.</p>
			
			<p>If you want them coming back and to spread the word about your town and the goldfields then they need to feel welcomed 
			and important. They need to experience a bit of goold old fashioned Australian country hospitality the moment they step 
			onto the platform. It does not have to be over the top, just genuine in an understated Australian way.</p>

			
			
			<h2>Possible experiences for visitors</h2>
			
			<p>The following is just a selection of ideas that could be explored. I am sure residents of Maryborough and surrounding towns 
			will come up with many more ideas.</p>
			
			<h3>Wagon &amp; Coach Rides</h3>
			
			<p>One really obvious experience for tourists, that cities like Ballarat and Bendigo would struggle with but that the 
			likes of Maryborough could EASILY provide, are wagon, stage coach and buggy rides. Both around the town center and 
			even between it and the closer satellite towns.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/WagonRide.jpg" alt="images/WagonRide.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>
			How about tours by horse around the lake, goldfields ruins and diggings?<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/TrailRides.jpg" alt="images/TrailRides.jpg" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Gold detecting</h3>
			
			<p>A small number of tourists, particuarly any Australians, would likely love to have a go at gold detecting.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/GoldDetetcting.jpg" alt="images/GoldDetetcting.jpg" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Gem stone fossicking</h3>
			
			<p>Australians like me are more interested in fossicking for quartz crystal and chalcedony varieites. And they are 
			a great deal easier to find than gold nuggets.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/GemFossicking.jpg" alt="images/GemFossicking.jpg" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Wildflowers</h3>
			
			<p>Many Australian tourists, including this one, LOVE Australian flora. And you have one prolific native wild flower across 
			the area that I have noticed in passing. Bracteantha viscosa or Sticky Everlasting Daisy. No doubt there are MANY other 
			species in spring, particularly when rainfall is good.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/WildFlowers.jpg" alt="images/WildFlowers.jpg" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Indigenous Australian Art Gallery</h3>
			
			<p>Bendigo as a European Art Gallery. So why could Maryborough feature an Indigenous Australian art gallery.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/Art.jpg" alt="images/Art.jpg" width="600"/>&nbsp;<img src="images/Culture.jpg" alt="images/Culture.jpg" width="630"/></p>
			
			<h3>Indigenous Australian Cultural Activities</h3>
			
			<p>How mabout a range of Indigenous Australian cultural experience. It could inlcude smoking ceremonies, teaching tourists 
			to start a fire without matches or flints, recognize bush tucker plants and how to prepare and eat them and how to locate 
			water. One indigenous Australian I know of, Richard, seems to be an encyclpedia of knowledge. It seems a waste if there is 
			no avenue for individuals such as him to share some their expertise with visitors.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/Culture.jpg" alt="images/Culture.jpg" width="630"/></p>
			
			<h3>Cycling</h3>
			
			<p>How about tours by cycle around the lake, goldfields ruins and diggings? With a steam train loop the rail trail, 
			currently under construction, would become yet another cycling experience for tourists. Rather than a bit a of a whie 
			elephant.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/Cycling.jpg" alt="images/Cycling.jpg" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Re-enactments At Historic sites</h3>
			
			<p>You have a 19th century police station / court house and lockup in Dunolly. So a coach, buggy, wagon or tour bus ride to 
			the court house to see a re-enactment of a court case conducted by members of any local drama societies and theatre companies.<br/><br/>
			<a href="https://www.bnt.org.au/past-productions"><img src="images/TheatreClub.jpg" alt="images/TheatreClub.jpg" /></a><br/><br/>
			<img src="images/DunollyCourtHouse.jpg" alt="images/DunollyCourtHouse.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>
			<img src="images/Reenactments.jpg" alt="images/Reenactments.jpg" width="600"/><br/><br/>

			<h3>Sewing machine museum &amp; other niche museums</h3>
			<p>At one point Maryborough apparently had a sewing machine museum, so bring that back! Along with some other small niche 
			museums. Crystals, gemstones and gold nugget relicas, particularly gold nuggets that have recently been found. Movie and 
			theatre memorabilia. Antique bottles and other atrifacts from the diggings.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/SewingMachine.png" alt="images/SewingMachine.png" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Historic Paramount theatre</h3>
			
			<p>You have a great 1926 vintage Paramount Theatrel. Apart form Hollywood movies you could create 30 minute documentaries detailing 
			various aspects of Maryborough's history. Show them to interested visitors in comfort, and then follow up the viewings 
			with tours of the sites featured.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/ParamountFacade.jpg" alt="images/ParamountFacade.jpg" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Public pool</h3>
			
			<p>It is apparently under rennovation and that is great. Put a splash park in it! But not a McSplash Park. 
			How about one with a goldfields twist. It could include structures that resemble sluices and boilers etc. 
			Something along these lines but that screams 'goldfield diggings'.<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/SplashPark.jpg" alt="images/SplashPark.jpg" width="600"/></p>

			<h3>Wind farm</h3>
			
			<p>What about connecting with the windfarm managers and taking tourists on an information tour of the wind farm! Some tourist would find 
			this very interesting.<br/><br/>
			<a href="https://www.acciona.com.au/nyaninyuk/?_adin=02021864894"><img src="images/Nyaninyuk.jpg" alt="images/Nyaninyuk.jpg" width="600"/></a></p>
			
			<h3>Bicyle hire</h3>
			
			<p>With a regular and signficant flow of tourists, due to the steam train service and re-instated train line between Castlemaine 
			and Maryborough, suddenly the rail trail becomes a GREAT idea. How about providing a bicycle and eBycycle hire service for your Rail Trail. 
			You could cooperate with Castlemaine and provide a hire service at both ends for Asian tourists who will not have their own bicycle. They 
			could hire at either the Maryborough or Castelmaine end and drop off the bike at the opposite end of the trail. Push bikes for those who are 
			fit and realish the 50km challenge. eBikes for the less fit.<br/><br/>
