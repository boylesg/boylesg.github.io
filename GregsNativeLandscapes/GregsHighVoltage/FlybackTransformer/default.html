			<h2>Flyback Transformers</h2>
					<h3>Building Your Own Transformer</h3>
					<h4>The Core</h4>
					<p>First of all you will need to obtain a core, which look 
					like this:</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="286" src="../images/FlybackTransformerCore.jpg" width="371" /></p>
					<p>You can salvage them from the circuit board of old 
					cathode ray TVs and monitors:</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="420" src="../images/CircuitBoardCathodeRayTV.jpg" width="550" /></p>
					<p>In this example you can see the flyback transformer in 
					the upper right corner, and also the core. It takes a bit of 
					effort to de-solder the flyback transformer from the circuit 
					board because their are 9 to 12 pins.<br />
					<br />
					The black plastic structure around it contain the primary 
					and secondary windings embedded in epoxy resin. You can use 
					the flyback transformer as is however there is a lot of 
					messing around with a multimter to figure out which pins are 
					attached to the primary winding and which are attached 
					attached to the high voltage secondary winding.These flyback 
					transformers also contain rectifier diodes and generate high 
					voltage DC current which limit what projects you can use 
					them for. For example you can't use them to drive a plasma 
					globe as they require AC high voltage current.</p>
					<p>Once it is off the circuit board to can proceed to remove 
					the core. But you need to do this carefully because the core 
					is generally held in the plastic assembly with dobs of hot 
					glue. This must be carefully picked away to free the core. 
					The ferrite cores are rather fragile and will easily break 
					if you try an lever out the two halves if the core with a 
					screw driver for example.</p>
					<h4>Make Your Own Bobbin</h4>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="195" src="../images/Bobbins.png" width="307" /></p>
					<p>This will be for the secondary transformer winding that 
					will generate the high voltage.</p>
					<p>The first thing you need to find is a plastic pipe that 
					nicely fits around the cylinderical part of the ferrite core 
					without rattling around too much. Smaller diameter PVC 
					pressure pipe or electrical conduit might be suitable. It is 
					just a matter of hunting around until you find something 
					suitable. </p>
					<p>If you luck in you might be able to find a complete 
					bobbin for electrical wire that is just the right size.</p>
					<p>Next you need to cut a length of pipe to the exact length 
					that fits inside the core with the two halves joined. It 
					should be a snug fit and should not move up and down inside 
					the core.</p>
					<p>Next you need to make some end disks for the bobbin. You 
					can make them out of presepex or PVC sheet. If hard pressed 
					you can cut a short length of large diameter PVC pipe, slit 
					it down its length, heat it in the oven at 120 degrees for 
					10 minutes until it becomes soft and pliable and then 
					sandwich it between 2 heavy sheets of MDF with a car b 
					attery or something else heavy to weigh the top sheet down. 
					The PVC will re-harden into a flat sheet.</p>
					<p>Use a 4-5cm diameter hole saw to cut out two disks:</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="222" src="../images/HoleSaw.jpg" width="227" /></p>
					<p>Then you will need to enlarge the hole at the center of 
					the disks to fit snuggly around the PVC pipe. You can use a 
					smaller diameter hole saw or a spade bit:</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="225" src="../images/SpadeBit.jpg" width="225" /></p>
					<p>You may need to use some sand paper wrapped around a 
					piece of dowel or PVC pipe, as a round file, to smooth off 
					the edges of the inner hole. Also lightly sand the ends of 
					the PVC pipe to provide a rough surface for the glue to key 
					onto.</p>
					<p>Make sure all the surfaces are free from greece and dirt 
					- clean everything with some soapy water and allow them to 
					dry thoroughly.</p>
					<p>Mix up some 2 part epoxy glue and coat the end of the PVC 
					pipe and stand it on a pefectly flat surface. Next slide one 
					fo the disks down the pipe and over the glue. Make sure the 
					PVC pipe is pefectly vertical and that the disk and the end 
					of the pipe are flush.<br />
					<br />
					You can use a tooth pick to make sure the gap between the 
					disk and the pipe is evenly filled with glue. Clean off any 
					excess with methylated spirits before the glue hardens. 
					Don't use too much metho or it will dissolve away the glue 
					from the gap. Waith for the epoxy glue to harden and then 
					repeat the process for the other end of the pipe.</p>
					<p>You will then need to drill a small hole in one of the 
					disks flush with the pipe. When you start winding you will 
					first poke the wire through this hole and sucure it inside 
					the pipe.</p>
					<h4>Magnet Wire</h4>
					<p>Old cathod ray TVs also have a good supply of magnet 
					wire.</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="405" src="../images/MagnetWire.jpg" width="720" />&nbsp;</p>
					<p>You can see the magnet wire on those funny shaped ferrite 
					cores. This whole plastic assembly is quite easy to break 
					apart. You will need to cut the wires to free the ferrite 
					cores. Then wind the magnet wire onto a handly bobbin or 
					length of thick dowel. There are usually dobs of hot glue on 
					the ferrite cores to prevent the magnet wire from 
					unravelling. However it is easy to break this apart and 
					scrape it off the magnet wire with your finger nails.</p>
					<p>If you need more length and if you have a steady hand 
					then it is possible to join lengths of magnet wire together 
					in a similar way to this, except with solder.</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="225" src="../images/SplicingMagnetWire.png" width="224" /></p>
					<p>You can restore the insulation around the solder joint 
					with a smear of epoxy glue.</p>
					<p>Of course if you can't be bothered with salvaging the 
					magnet wire then you can always buy a reel of it. AWG 23 to 
					28 is OK.</p>
					<h4>Winding The Secondary Coil</h4>
					<p>This is a Tesla Coil secondary coil but the idea is the 
					same:</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="168" src="../images/WindingSecondaryCoil.jpg" width="300" /></p>
					<p>Once you reach the end of the bobbin wrap the winding 
					with one layer of duct tape with the ends overlapping. Make 
					sure the duct tape rides up the disks slightly so the wire 
					of the next layer can't slip off the end of the duct tape 
					and contact the wire of the winding below. Also do a right 
					angle bend in the wire and take it back to the side of the 
					bobbin you started winding from over the top of the PVC 
					tape. Then take the remaining overlapping duct tape and 
					stick it down.<br />
					<br />
					Repeat this process as many times as it takes to fill up the 
					bobbin almost to the edge of the disks.<br />
					<br />
					The PVC tape between layers of windings prevents HV 
					discahrges inside the coil between layers if windings. The 
					break down voltage of PVC tape is around 10kV and the 
					difference between layers of windings should be less than 
					that.</p>
					<h4>Electrical Contacts</h4>
					<p>You can stick 2x of these terminal blocks to each of the 
					bobbin disks, without obstructing the lumen of the pipe. </p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="222" src="../images/TerminalBlock.jpg" width="321" /></p>
					<p>You will need to lightly sand the edges of the bobbin 
					disks and the bottom of the terminal blocks. This allows the 
					glue to gain purchase. Two of these terminal blocks will 
					provide a greater surface area for the glue, but you will 
					only need to use one side.</p>
					<p>Glue these at either end og the bobbin the distance 
					between them, as well as the fact the terminal blocks will 
					be submerged in oil, will pevent any unauthorised HV 
					discharges.</p>
					<p>You will need to strip the ends of the magnet wire with a 
					match and some fine emery paper. Fold the end of the wire 
					2-3 times and solder the folds together. This will provide a 
					large target for the screws of the terminal block to bite on 
					to.</p>
					<p>Into the other end of the terminal block clamp a short 
					length of much thicker diameter wire. This will be easier to 
					handle than the fine magnet wire. The inner conductors of 
					standard house hold apliance cables are ideal. </p>
					<h4>Transformer Oil</h4>
					<p>It is a good idea to submerge the whole transformer in 
					oil to further reduce the likelhood of HV discharges within 
					the transformer. An ideal oil is liquid paraffin or baby 
					oil. It has a much higher break down voltage than does air.</p>
					<p>
					<img alt="" height="355" src="../images/LiquidParaffin.jpg" width="140" /></p>
					<p>You also need to expose the trasnformer submerged in oil 
					to a vacuum for a day or so. This is to make sure that as 
					much air as possible is sucked out from between the layers 
					of windwings and PVC tape.</p>
					<p>I did it with a short length of PVC pipe with two end 
					caps. One end cap is glued on permanently while the other is 
					glued on temporarily with a bead of silcone sealant along 
					the edge of the PVC cap.</p>
					<p>I have isntalled a tap in this PVC cap with rubber 
					washers of taps sealing the hole. I used a brass nut on the 
					inside of the cap to create a tight seal.</p>
					<p>Then I simply used my mouth and tongue to draw out as 
					much air as I could and then closed the tap.</p>
