						<br/>
						<li>Compared to all of the commonly available exotic turf grass species, native grasses have exceptionally 
							deep root systems that enable them to reach moisture deep within the sub-soil that is simply out of 
							the reach of the exotic turf grasses.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>For example the roots of the native grass Bothriochloa macra have been recorded at reaching a depth of
							1.2m. The roots of Microlaena stipoides will reach a depth of 30cm or more.</li>
	
						<li>Indeed the one thing that you notice about native grass tufts is that they are very difficult or 
							impossible to pull out of the soft ground compared to most exotic grass species, that can often be pulled
							out with minimal effort.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>It is these exceptionally deep root systems that give native grasses their exceptional resistance to 
							water stress and allow them to survive over our sometimes severe droughts.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>The native grass species are 'Griffin' Microlaena stipoides, 'Oxley' Austrodanthonia geniculata &amp; 'Bass' Bothriochloa macra

					<ul class="List">
						<li>Native lawns are sown from seed in the same way as conventional exotic turfs, however they are much slower 
							to establish. PATIENCE &amp; PERSEVERANCE is required.&nbsp;</li>
						<br/>
						<li>The main difference is that native grass seeds take longer to germinate than many exotic grass seeds, and 
							the seedlings are fairly slow growing at first. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>This makes freshly sown native lawns very prone to being swamped by much faster growing weeds.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Native grass seeds will not germinate unless subjected to a period of sustained moisture in the soil, 
							generally from late April to December. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>This is a specific adaptation to unreliable rainfall over much of the Australian continent. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>The delay in germination ensures that the seeds do not germinate after short lived rainfall, after which 
							the soil dries out again killing any small germinates.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>You may have noticed that this can be a problem with, for example, Tall Fescue lawns. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>The seeds are quick to germinate but can just as quickly die if you forget to water them for a day or two 
							over summer. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>In contrast young native grass seedlings are far more likely to hang on until you remember to water them 
							again.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>After germination growth is slow for the 12 months or so. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>During this period the grass plants are establishing their extensive root systems that will then be capable 
							of sustaining large amounts of foliage.</li>

					<h2><a name="Weed Control">Weed Control</a></h2>
					<ul class="List">
						<li>Weed control is critical during establishment of a native lawn.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>
							As you can see from the photo below, native grasses generally grow slowly for the first 12 months, but 
							unfortunately most exotic broad leaf weeds and weedy grasses grow very rapidly.<br/>
							<a href="images/Oxley_AustrodanthoniaLawnNew.jpg">
								<img alt="" src="images/Oxley_AustrodanthoniaLawnNew.jpg" class="Image"/>
							</a>
							<br/>
							You can see in this photo of a recently sown 'Oxley' Austrodanthonia lawn that the small fine leaf 
							Austrodanthonia seedlings are being swamped by the assorted weeds that grow much faster.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>If left unchecked they will quickly swamp the young native grass seedlings, ultimately leading to a very 
							patchy and unsightly lawn. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>You can see in this photo of a different section of the same lawn that the many of the Austrodanthonia 
							seedlings in this part of the lawn are stunted due to the thicker growth of weedy grasses here (since mowed 
							and spot sprayed).<br/>
							<a href="images/Oxley_AustrodanthoniaLawnNewSprayedMowed2.jpg">
								<img alt="" src="images/Oxley_AustrodanthoniaLawnNewSprayedMowed2.jpg" class="Image"/>
							</a>
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>However if the weeds are kept under control long enough for the native grasses to become well established, 
							then your native lawn will become quite resistant to further weed invasion.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Fortunately their are some easy techniques for keeping the weeds under control.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>And you can see in this photo of the same lawn with some weed control applied to it that the Austrodanthonia 
							seedlings are now more apparent and the lawn in this section is coming along particularly nicely:<br/>
							<a href="images/Oxley_AustrodanthoniaLawnNewSprayedMowed.jpg">
								<img alt="" src="images/Oxley_AustrodanthoniaLawnNewSprayedMowed.jpg" class="Image"/>
							</a>
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>And as long as you are PATIENT and persistent with weed control for 12 months or so, this is what you will 
							end up with:<br/>
							<a href="images/Oxley_Austrodanthonia_geniculata.jpg">
								<img src="images/Oxley_Austrodanthonia_geniculata.jpg" class="Image"/>
							</a>
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Once you get this stage your lawn will require little or no ongoing watering, little ongoing weed control, 
							no fertilising and you don't even necessarily have to mow it.</li>

					<h3 id="Terminology">Terminology</h3>
					<ul class="List">
						<li>All plants are divided into to the two very broad groups, monocotyledons and dicotyledons.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Among the differences between them are the fact that:
							<ul class="List">
								<li>Dicotyledons have highly variable shaped leaves with branching veins.</li>
								<li>Monocotyledons have simple strappy leaves with parallel veins.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Dicotyledons are further divided into a further two very broad groups:
							<ul class="List">
								<li>Herbaceous plants or herbs: those that produce no woody tissue - many common weedy monocotyledons 
									are also referred to as herbs because they similarly do not produce woody tissue.</li>
								<li>Woody weeds: essentially trees and shrubs that all produce woody stems.</li>

					<h3 id="Sprayers">Sprayers</h3>
	
					<p>Always use proper chemical handling precuations when using herbicides, inlcuding gloves, long sleeve shirts or jumpers, 
					long pants and waterproof boots of some sort. Beware of hervicide mixes or concentrates spalshing in your eyes and never
					spray with the wind blowing into your face or onto your back - in both cases you will wind of wearing the herbicide. If 
					you get it o your skin or face then wash it off with soapy water asap.</p>

						<li>The herbicides MCPA and dicamba are ideal for selective control of broadleaf weeds in native lawns.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>You should look for these specific herbicides in the &quot;ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS&quot; of any products you 
							purchase.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Fortunately a there is a readily available product that contains these two herbicides:</li><br/>
							<a href="images/ZeroBindiiAndClover.png"><img alt="" src="images/ZeroBindiiAndClover.png" class="ImageSmall" /></a>
							<ul>
								<li>I would recommend 100ml of this concentrate for every 10L of water, or 10ml of concentrate for every 
									1L or water.</li>
								<li>You also need a small amount of detergent in the mixture to ensure that mixture does not form beads on the  
									surface of the weed leaves, as this will reduce the effectiveness of the herbicide and may not kill the 
									weeds.</li>
								<li>About 30ml of ordinary liquid dishwashing detergent, for every 10L or water, will do the trick.</li>
								<li>You can also add a small amount of blue food colouring to the mix so you can tell where you have sprayed.</li>
								<li>You can simply overspray the whole lawn and the native grass seedlings will not be effected.</li>
							</ul>
						<br/>
						<li>There are also herbicide products that contain the active ingredient triclopyr such as:</li><br/>
							<a href="images/YatesTreeAndBlackberryKiller.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/YatesTreeAndBlackberryKiller.jpg" class="ImageSmall"/></a>

						<br/>
						<li>It is generally used to kill woody weeds such as blackberry and Boxthorn however it can also be used to 
							kill broadleaf weeds.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>In general it is selective for broadleaf weeds and does not harm grasses. </li>
						<br/>
						<li>However there is one very notable exception to this rule, and that exception is the native grass Microlaena
	            			stipoides.</li>

					</ul>
	
					<h4 id="Recommended Herbicide Product0">Recommended Herbicide Product</h4>

						<br/>
						<li>It is a non-selective herbicide and will kill your native grasses just as effectively as the weeds, so be 
							careful with it.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Here is the most recognizable herbicide product that contain glyphosate as it active constituent:</li><br/>
							<ul class="List">
								<li>Roundup concentrate:</li><br/>
									<a href="images/RoundupConcentrate.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/RoundupConcentrate.jpg" class="ImageSmall"/></a><br/>

									<li>General use: 100ml concentrate per 10L of water OR 10ml concentrate per 1L of water</li>
									<li>Tough weeds: 200ml concentrate per 10L of water OR 20ml concentrate per 1L of water</li>
									<li>It is also advisable to add 30ml of liquid diswashing detergent to the mix.</li>

					<h3 id="Spot Spraying">Spot Spraying</h3>
					<ul class="List">
						<li>If you are practiced at the use of the spray packs above then it is possible to carefully spot spray weedy 
							grasses in a native lawn, with glyphosate, while doing little or no damage to the native grasses.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>However that generally takes a couple years practice to be able to do a really good job of it and is a 
							matter of:</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Adjusting down the angle of the spray cone with the screw adjustment at the end of the wand.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Holding the end of the wand close to the ground to further reduce the size of the spray cone.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Carefully controlling the flow rate if herbicide from the wand via the trigger on the handle - this is the 
							most tricky part to get the hang of.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Angling the spray cone away from the surrounding native grasses - this is also tricky to get the hang of.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>This technique is particularly useful for annual, biannual and perennial grasses.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>But, if the weeds are particularly over grown, then mow first and wait for a small amount of new foliage 
							to sprout.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>By doing this you will make it easier to avoid off target glyphosate damage.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h3 id="Painting & Dabbing">Painting &amp; Dabbing</h3>
					<ul class="List">
						<li>For dabbing and painting I recommend you use neat glyphosate concentrate.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Shoe polish dabber bottles are ideal for this:</li>
						<br/>
						<a href="images/Dabber.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/Dabber.jpg" class="Image"/></a>
						<br/>
						<li>Otherwise a small paint brush will suffice.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>With this technique you simply dab the herbicide on as much of the plant as possible without also getting 
							it on nearby native grasses.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>The concentrated glyphosate will compensate for the fact that you are not able to&nbsp;cover all the 
							foliage of the weedy grass.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>This technique is particularly useful for annual, biannual and perennial grasses.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h3 id="Cut & Paint">Cut &amp; Paint</h3>
					<ul class="List">
						<li>This technique is particularly useful for larger broadleaf weeds that have a well defined main stem, e.g. 
							the blue flowered mallow, or any shrubs and trees.,</li><br/>
							<a href="images/MarshMallow.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/MarshMallow.jpg"/></a>
						<br/><br/>
						<li>Just use a pair of secateurs to cut the main stem as close to ground level as possible and then, within 
							seconds, dab the stump with neat glyphosate.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>This technique of applying herbicde is very effective, and you can use glyphosate on weeds like blue 
							flowered mallow that are normally resistant to glyphosate when applied to their foliage.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>There is no need to dig out large tap roots.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 id="Dilute Glyphosate">Dilute Glyphosate</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>This technique can be used as a last resort on well established native lawns, as in the photos below.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>By reducing the concentration of glyphosate in the mix you reduce the effectiveness of the glyphosate on 
							perennial grasses (both native and weedy) while still maintaining its effectiveness on many annual weedy 
							grasses.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Your native grasses will be burned back however they will recover in time while the weedy annual grasses 
							will be killed outright.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>With this technique you 10ml of glyphosate concentrate in 10L of water, or 1ml of glyphosate concentrate 
							in 1L or water, plus 30ml of dishwashing liquid as before.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>This technique is particularly useful for wiping out winter grass without doing any long term harm to the 
							native grasses.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>But always try and minimise off target spraying of the surrounding native grass as much as possible.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>The best time to do it is when the cold days when most native grasses are the least active while Poa annua 
							is highly active.</li>
						<br/>
						<li><b>Do not try this on a recently sown native lawn as there is a risk that the young native grass seedlings 
							will be killed out right.</b></li>
					</ul>
	
					<h3 id="Mowing">Mowing</h3>
					<ul class="List">
						<li>Simply mowing your establishing native lawn is also effective, particularly for annual and biannual weeds.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>These are weeds that grow, flower, set seed and then die within a year or two years.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>By mowing, you prevent them from dropping seeds into the soil and replacing themselves a 1000s of times 
							over in the following season and years.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Then they will die of their own accord without the need to use herbicides on them.</li>
						<br/>
						<li>Or you can just wait a bit for a small amount of new foliage to grow and then spot spray or dab them with 
							herbicide, thus making it easier to avoid off target herbicide damage.</li>
						<br/>
					</ul>
	
					<h3 id="Hand weeding">Hand weeding</h3>
					<p>
						If the area of native lawn is small and the infestation of weedy grasses is not to thick then this is probably 
						the best option as you will do little or no damage to surrounding native grasses.
