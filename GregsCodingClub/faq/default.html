		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<p><span class="style_bold">Q: What is coding?</span><br />
		A: 
		Humans comincate in English, or some other language. Human languages are 
		very imprecise with the meaning behind a sentence often being dependant 
		on tone and syllabal emphasis etc. Also there are often many ways of 
		constructing a sentence that means exactly the same thing. Computers 
		commincate in binary code, or 1s and 0s, in very rigidly precise ways, 
		with no vairation. It is extraodinarily difficult for a human to 
		communcate with a computer in just 1s and 0s. Hence the pioneers in 
		computer technology developed special languages that were some where 
		between plain English and digital 1s and 0s. Low level languages, like 
		assembly language, use 3 letter codes for particularl instructions. An 
		example would be MOV which mean move a value from one place in memory to 
		another. It is also quite hard to program a computer in assembly 
		language beyond very simple programs. Hence mid level languages, like C 
		and Pascal, were developed. These use more intuitive programing 
		constructs, with keywords like 'if' and 'while', to construct for 
		complex programs. These days high level languages are used to write 
		programs, often involving drag and drop jigsaw puzzle like peices that 
		fit together in particular ways. In all cases the computer code is 
		converted to digital 1s and 0s so that the computer can carry out the 
		program.</p>
		<hr />
		<p><span class="style_bold">Q: Where do I start?</span><br />
		A: You can start by googling and reading as much as possible about coding.
		Coding is not one thing, it is many things, like building.
		With building there is brick laying, framing, tiling, electrical, plumbing,......
		With coding there is web development, windows app development, mobile phone app development, 
		micrcontroller programming & digital electronics, unix app development,.......
		Where you start with coding depends on which of the above most interests you. </p>
		<hr />
		<p><span class="style_bold">Q: What language is easiest to learn?</span><br />
		A: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>No one language is easier to learn coding with than another.</li>
			<li>Learning the syntax of a language is a VERY MINOR part of learning to code.</li>
			<li>Learning to think logically, to break large problems down into small bits that are then 
			easy to code, learning to use functions and parameters properly and learning to write efficient 
			code that is easy to understand - they are hard to learn and take time and LOTS of practice. 
			You WILL NOT learn this any faster with Python than you will with C and C++.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		So what language should you learn first? Which ever one that you personally find the most aesthetically 
		pleasing, the one that you have the most interest in learning and the one you are most likely to stick at 
		when the learning gets TOUGH!
		</p>
		<p>HTML can't be learned in isolation from CSS, Javascript and PHP. All are required to create interactive 
		and responsive web pages. PHP and Javascript have the same issues as detailed above.</p>
		<hr />
		<p><span class="style_bold">Q: What is the best laptop of desktop o 
		learn coding on?</span><br />
		A:If the laptop or desktop is capable of running Windows 10 or Windows 
		11 then it is suitable to learn coding with.</p>
		<hr />
		<p><span class="style_bold">Q: What software do I need?</span><br />A: That depends on what language you are learning.
		
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Web programming (HTML, Javascript, CSS): MS Expression Web is great software. It is deprecated however it is 
				perfectly fine for beginners and it is totally FREE. An alternative is MS VS Code with the appropriate plugins 
				installed.</li>
			<li>Python: Thonny,  Visual Studio Code with the correct plugins.</li>
			<li>C/C++/C+: MS Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Code with the correct plugins.</li>
			<li>Arduino microcontrollers: Arduino IDE</li>
			<li>Raspberry Pi Pico MCU: Thonny</li>
			<li>Games: Unity.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<p><span class="style_bold">Q: What jobs are there for programmers?</span><br />
		A: Banks, insurance companies, gambling companies and game developers 
		are big empoyers of programmers. There are also niche jobs in small tech 
		start up and industrial automation companies. But technology and 
		automation is finding its way into more and more industries, and if you 
		don't know a little about coding then you will likely be left behind in 
		low paid jobs in coming decades.</p>
