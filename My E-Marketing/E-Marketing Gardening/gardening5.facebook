If you want a low maintenance garden then you need to employ the power of ground covers to supress weed growth.

All of the common garden weeds are ecological 'colonisers'.

In the wild they specialise in colonising  baren lava fields and landslide sites etc. where other species struggle to gain a toe hold.

For this reason they a not tolerant of shade and root competion etc.

So if your garden beds are bare at soil level then you are providing the perfect conditions for weeds to grow.

Select one or more ground cover species that will entirely cover the ground in your garden beds, and deny the weeds the space and light to grow.
