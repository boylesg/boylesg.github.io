Did you know there are plenty of native plant species that you can hedge?

Examples are Correa glabram or Rock Correa, Spyridium parvifolium or Dusty Miller, Backhousia citriodora or Lemon Myrtle, Acacia accinacea or Golden Dust Wattle, 
Myoporum viscosum or Sticky Boobialla, Myporum insulare or Common Boobialla and there are many others.

And they are far more drought and clay tolerant than traditional exotic species.
