If you have a water feature in your garden then consider filling it with native aquatic plants. Without aquatic plants you leave ecological space for 
algae to grow instead. Aquatic plants take up any nutrients in the water and outcompete the algae.

They also form a foundation on which a healthy aquatic ecosystem, that includes micoscopic predators, can develop. And that will greatly suppress mosquitos 
and other undesriable insects.
