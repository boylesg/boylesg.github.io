			G'day from a fellow tradie: I'd like to take a moment of your time to introduce 
			you to my 
			new advertising app for tradies. It is called 
			<a href=../”https:/www.find-a-tradie.com.au”>Find-a-Tradie</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="cid:home@page" alt="HOME PAGE" width="800"/>
		</p>
		<p>
			As a gardener myself I have created 
			<a href=../”https:/www.find-a-tradie.com.au”>Find-a-Tradie</a> with the 
			mindset of a tradie, and with the needs of tradies in mind. In the current economic circumstances, I am sure 
			that you are feeling the financial pressure as people stop or reduce their discretionary spending. Especially 
			if you are a tradie in sectors which typically have low job values and high competition, such as gardening, 
			lawn mowing etc. Alternatively, if you have just started out as a new 
			small business tradie, then you will be able to promote 
			your business at minimal cost. 
		</p>
		<p>
			With my competitors such as HiPages, ServiceSeeking and OneFlare you can 
			easily find yourself spending more money on advertising with them over a month than you can earn from paid 
			jobs through them. This is because you have to ‘spend’ points or pay 
			extra to obtain customer contact details, regardless 
			of whether you end up winning those jobs. That is not an issue with 
			<a href=../”https:/www.find-a-tradie.com.au”> Find-a-Tradie</a>. We only charge you a flat annual membership 
			fee of $10 per month or $120 per year. In addition, for that, you can try for as many jobs as you want - 
			there is no limit. You are guaranteed to make more money than you spend on membership over 12 months. 
			However, every new tradie regardless of when you join up gets their 
			first 6 months of membership for no fee.</p>
		<p>
			Also unlike my competitors, I will not unilaterally create an account for your business without your consent 
			and then invite you to take control of it. This email is an invitation to you to register your own account if 
			you think <a href=../”https:/www.find-a-tradie.com.au”> Find-a-Tradie</a> may be of benefit to your small trade 
			business. Customers, who are looking for a tradie, can join for no charge at all times. 
		</p>
		<p>
			What is different 
			about <a href=../”https:/www.find-a-tradie.com.au”> Find-a-Tradie</a> compared to the other HiPages, 
			ServiceSeeking and OneFlare?
		</p>
		<p>
			The service uses a feedback based mutual trust system similar to eBay.
		</p> 
		<p>

		</p>
		<p> 
			BOTH customers AND tradies need to be members in order to use this service. And that is because BOTH are 
			subject to feedback history.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tradies can check the feedback history (have they always paid on time, are they easy to deal with,…..) of 
			clients, before deciding to do any jobs for them.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to customers being able to check a tradie's feedback history before deciding whether or not to 
			engage them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="cid:tradie@feedback" alt="images/tradie_feedback.jpg" width="800"/>
		</p>
		<p> 
			If this sounds like a better way to advertise your business and get 
			paid jobs then sign up to day. Remember your first 6 months membership will cost you nothing.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Thanks for your time.
