https://www.find-a-tradie.com.au is a new advertising service for tradies.

It has been created by me, a domestic gardener and landscaper myself, for other tradies.

As a tradie, you can browse the feedback history of customers to ensure that they track record of paying on time and in full.

We require customers to also register an account before being able to post jobs.

It is a mutual trust system very similar to that used by eBay.
