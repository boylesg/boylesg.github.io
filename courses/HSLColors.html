			function are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li><b>hue: </b>this must be between 0 an 360 and represents an angle on the color wheel.<br/>
					<img src="images/ColorWheel.png" alt="images/ColorWheel.png" width="300" />
				</li>
				<br/><br/>
				<li><b>saturation: </b>this must be between 0 and 100 and represents how greyed the color appears. 0 (0%) means the 
					color just appears as grey while 100 (100%) means there is no greying of the color at all.
				</li>
				<br/><br/>
				<li><b>lightness: </b>this must be between 0 and 100 and represents how darkened or lightened the color appears. 
					0 (0%) means the color appears as black, 100 (100%) means that the color appears as pure white and 50 (50%) 
					means that the color is normal.
				</li>
