		<h4>Hex Colors</h4>
		<p>
			Red, green and blue are primary colors, that is they are not made by combining other colors. On the other hand yelow
			is made by combining red and green, cyan is made by combining blue and green, magenta is made by combining red and 
			blue and white is made by combining red, green and blue. Cyan, yellow, magenta and white are referred to as secondary
			colors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now by varying the amount of red, green and blue you can create any color that you can imagine. This is where hex 
			colors come in. In CSS a hex color is flagged via the character #. Following that there should be 3 sets of 2 digit
			hex integers that specify the amount of red, green and blue light:<br/><br/>
			# 03 A6 D5<br/><br/>
			Those spaces are there just to make things clearer for you and you would not normally include them. But 03 is the amount
			of red light, A6 is the amount of green light and D5 is the amount of blue light. What color is that? 
			<span style="background-color:#03A6D5">Here it is!</span>
