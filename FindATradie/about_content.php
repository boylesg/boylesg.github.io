	<h6><b>Who created <u>www.find-a-tradie.com.au?</u></b></h6>
	<p>
		Find a Tradie was created by my brother and myself. I am a former medical scientist, former programmer 
		and I have been a small business gardener/landscaper for the past <?php echo $nYears; ?> years. My 
		brother is still a programmer. I still love the creativity and problem solving involved with building 
		web sites and software, and have put my programming skills to good use building, maintaining and hosting 
		my own landscaping business web site. As well as half dozen other web sites for my self and a friend.
	</p>
	<h6><b>Why did we create <u>www.find-a-tradie.com.au?</u></b></h6>
	<p>
		Recently I explored advertising on other similar tradie advertising web services and was rather disgusted 
		at the level of gouging that they engaging in. I was quoted $109 PER MONTH, that essentially gave me 7 or 
		so chances to 'purchase' client contact details and obtain a paying job.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a gardener/landscaper, in particular, it is quite hard to get decent jobs that exceed 1-2 hours, 
		and pay more than $100 or so. Combine that with 30-60 minutes drive time between jobs and you can easily 
		end up working for minimum wage or barely above it. And rising interest rates, rising cost of living over 
		the last few years are dissuading so many people from spending on many trade services altogether. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Combine that with high level of competition in many trade services and I could easily spend as much on 
		advertising with these companies over a year than I would likely earn from any gardening jobs I obtained 
		through them. And I doubt that I am the only tradie who is experiencing this issue. Nor the only tradie 
		who feels that the 'suits' behind these companies gouging such a high gauranteed income from us really 
		sucks when it is we who do all the hard work in the heat or the rain outdoors!
	</p>
	<p>
		So these are the two reasons why my brother and I have created <b><u>www.find-a-tradie.com.au</u></b>. 
		Not in small part is the satisfaction of leveraging my programming skills to give other small business 
		tradies like me, and indeed myself, a fair go. And I am old enough to remember when this country was built 
		on the foundation of giving all workers a fair go.
