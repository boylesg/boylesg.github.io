	<h4><b>Who created <u>www.find-a-tradie.com.au?</u></b></h4>
	<p>
		Find-a-tradie was created by myself. I am a former medical scientist, former commercial programmer 
		and I have been a small business gardener/landscaper for the past <?php echo $nYears; ?> years. I still 
		love the creativity and problem solving involved with building web sites and software.
	</p>
	<h4><b>Why did I create <u>www.find-a-tradie.com.au?</u></b></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Advertising at my competitors costs of the order of $109 per month or more and you have to spend credits to 
			obtain customer contact details.</li>
		<li>You can easily spend more on advertising with them than you can earn from jobs obtained through them. </li> 
		<li>Especially for trades like gardening where job values are generally low and competition for jobs is high .</li>
		<li>Small business tradies like myself deserve a fair go.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4><b>Benefits of <u>www.find-a-tradie.com.au</u> over the competition</b></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>You can edit or delete any job you post if you change your mind.</li>
		<li>find-a-tradie uses a mutual trust and feedback system similar to eBay, so you can form your own judgement 
		as to whether a tradie or a customer is trust worthy.</li>
		<li>Customers can browse tradies, view their feedback history and obtain their contact details.</li>
		<li>Tradies can view customers feedback history.</li>
		<li>Tradies can manage their jobs - accept them and mark them as completed and paid.	</li>
	</ul>
