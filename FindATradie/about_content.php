<h4><b>Who created www.find-a-tradie.com.au?</b></h4>
	<p>
		Find-a-tradie was created by myself. I am a former medical scientist, former commercial programmer 
		and I have been a small business gardener/landscaper for the past <?php echo $g_nYears; ?> years. I still 
		love the creativity and problem solving involved with building web sites and software. So creating 
		<b><u>find-a-tradie.com.au</u></b> has been a passion project for me.
	</p>

<h4><b>Why did I create <u>find-a-tradie.com.au</u>?</b></h4>
	<ul>
		<li class="list">Advertising at my competitors costs of the order of $109 per month, or more, and you have to spend credits to 
			obtain customer contact details.</li>
		<li class="list">You can easily spend more on advertising with my competitors than you can earn from jobs obtained through them:<br/><br/>
			<ul>
				<li class="sublist">Especially when you are a brand new business and have not yet developed a word of mouth reputation.</li> 
				<li class="sublist">Especially for trades like gardening where job values are generally low and competition for jobs is high .</li>
			</ul> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Small business tradies, like myself, deserve a fairer go.</p>

<h4><b>Feedback System</b></h4>

	</p>
	<p>Feedback is where find-a-tradie is different. We use a feedback based mutual trust system similar to eBay.</p>
	
	<p>If the client refuses to pay the tradie or delays payment for an unacceptable period of time then the tradie can 
		leave negative feedback for the client and warn other tradies.</p>
		
	<p>Similarly the client can leave the tradie negative feedback if the tradie does not complete the work in a 
		reasonable amount of time or if their work is sub standard.</p>

	<p>Accountability goes both ways on find-a-tradie.</p>
	
	<p>Negative feedback will have an email link for the member who left the negative feedback and it is up to both 
		parties to negotiate turning negative feedback into positive feedback.</p>
