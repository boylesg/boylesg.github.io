		<h4>RGB &amp; RGBA Colors</h4>
		<p>
			Red, green and blue are primary colors, that is they are not made by combining other colors. On the other hand yelow
			is made by combining red and green, cyan is made by combining blue and green, magenta is made by combining red and 
			blue and white is made by combining red, green and blue. Cyan, yellow, magenta and white are referred to as secondary
			colors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now by varying the amount of red, green and blue you can create any color that you can imagine. This is where rgb 
			colors come in. In CSS an rgb color is specified by a call to the Javascript function 'rgb(amount_red, amount_green, amount_blue)'. 
			The parameters amount_red, amount_green, amount_blue specify the amount of red, green and blue light and should be 
			numbers between 0 and 255, e.g. rgb(50, 250, 100). What color is that? 
			<span style="background-color:rgb(50, 250, 100)">Here it is!</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also use the JavaScript function 'rgb(amount_red, amount_green, amount_blue, transparency)'. The first 3 parameters 
			are the same as for the function 'rgb(...)'. The fourth parameter specifies the tasparency of the color and your be a number 
			between 0 and 1 where 0 is fully transparent and  1 is fully opaque, e.g. rgb(50, 250, 100, 0.5). 
			Let's see the difference side by side.<br/>
			<span style="background-color:rgb(50, 250, 100)">XXXX</span><span style="background-color:rgba(50, 250, 100, 0.5)">XXXX</span>
		</p>
		<p>An advantage of rgb and rgba colors is that you can specify red, green and blue amounts as more familiar decimal numbers.</p>
